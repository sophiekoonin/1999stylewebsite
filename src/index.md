My name is Sophie and this is my 
<p class="marquee">State of the Browser 2022</p>
homepage! 


I made this site to demonstrate how we might build silly and creative homepages just like we did in the 90s/00s, but with <span class="">modern CSS, HTML and JS.</span>

<span class="rainbow">Thanks for visiting!</span>
